A Python library inspired by the [3d-building-metrics repo](https://github.com/tudelft3d/3d-building-metrics) designed to create a pipeline for assessing building similarity. This library automatically collects data from the [3D-BAG](https://docs.3dbag.nl/en/) and compares buildings using a turning function, metrics from the 3d-building-metrics repo, and general BAG data. It consists of three main modules: collection, processing, and similarity_calculation. These modules are integrated into a comprehensive module called BuildingsSimilarity.

- The **collection** module downloads CityJSON files from the 3D-BAG based on a list of [BAG IDs](https://www.geobasisregistraties.nl/basisregistraties/adressen-en-gebouwen) or a [neighborhood ID](https://catalogus.kadaster.nl/brt/en/page/Buurt?clang=nl).
- The **processing** module merges the downloaded CityJSON files, calculates 2D/3D metrics, filters out unsuitable buildings (based on abnormal metric values), and applies a turning function. The output is a Pandas Dataframe containing the BAG IDs and the calculated metrics.
- The **similarity_calculation** module preprocesses the data for similarity calculation by scaling, normalizing, handling N/A values and selecting relevant columns. The most basic form of similarity_calculation is to calculate the distance between two individual buildings. More advanced options are to calculate a (reference) distance matrix or to run ML-algorithms such as DBSCAN or K-Means

## Prerequisites

- python==3.11
- An API key for the BAG. If you don't have one, you can [apply](https://www.kadaster.nl/zakelijk/producten/adressen-en-gebouwen/bag-api-individuele-bevragingen) for it free of charge

## Usage
All modules can be used individually but are combined in BuildingSimilarity. Go to the demo directory for an example of how to use the module.

## Installation

Clone the repo & install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RetrofitEuropeGroup/FF_BuildingSimilarityIndex.git
cd FF_BuildingSimilarityIndex
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to provide the `BAG_API_KEY` as an environmental variable. You can do this by setting an environmental variable directly or with a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. The code loads environmental values from the `.env` file. The `.env` file only needs one line:

```
BAG_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Make sure to replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual BAG API key.


<br/><br/>
Note, it might be that you run in the following error: <i>ImportError: libXrender.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</i>
This error should be solved by running the following command:
```bash
ImportError: libXrender.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
